# governance

*Last modified: 2025-12-15*

rainbowR is currently in the process of formalising its governance. 

This repo contains rainbowR policies. Note that some are currently in draft form, or have yet to be ratified by the community.

This repo contains:

- Our [constitution](constitution.md). This is currently in draft form. The rainbowR membership will vote on whether to adopt it at our Inaugral General Meeting on January 28th, 2026. 
- Our [Code of Conduct](CoC.md)
- Our [committee policy](committee_policy.md)

We welcome feedback on our governance documents. 
This may be in the form of an [issue raised in this repo](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/governance/issues), or by email.
For comments and questions regarding the Code of Conduct, write to [coc@rainbowr.org](mailto:coc@rainbowr.org). For all other governance documents, to [hello@rainbowr.org](mailto:hello@rainbowr.org).
